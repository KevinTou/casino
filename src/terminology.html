        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>Blackjack:</dt>
          <dd>a two-card twenty-one (21), usually with an Ace and any ten-valued (10) card. This is usually paid with
            three-to-two
            odds (3:2) as opposed to even money (1:1)</dd>
          <dt>Bet:</dt>
          <dd>a wager or the amount that the player wishes to gamble</dd>
          <dt>Face cards:</dt>
          <dd>cards with a value of ten (10). Face cards are usually denoted as Jack, Queen, or King. 10s can also be
            considered
            a "face card" </dd>
          <dt>Insurance:</dt>
          <dd>this occurs when the dealer's face up card is an Ace. The player has the option to wager up to half of
            their bet,
            if they think the dealer has a Blackjack, to "save" their bet. If the player makes the insurance bet and
            the
            dealer does not have Blackjack, then the player loses their insurance bet and the game continues as normal
          </dd>
          <dt>Even money:</dt>
          <dd>when a bet is paid the same amount (1:1) </dd>
          <dt>Surrender:</dt>
          <dd>while the player still has their initial two cards, they can decide to surrender if they think they
            cannot beat
            the dealer. The player gives up half of their bet to the dealer and keeps the other half</dd>
          <dt>Double-Down:</dt>
          <dd>the act of placing an additional bet (up to the original bet) and receiving ONLY one card. This can only
            occur
            when the player's hand has two cards</dd>
          <dt>Split:</dt>
          <dd>if you are dealt two cards of equal value, you have the option of "splitting" them into two separate
            hands. You
            must match your original bet. Y </dd>
          <dt>Soft hand:</dt>
          <dd>a hand where the Ace can be considered 1 or 11 </dd>
          <dt>Hard hand:</dt>
          <dd>a hand where the Ace is considered 11</dd>
          <dt>Bust/Busting:</dt>
          <dd>a bust, or busting hand, is a losing hand where the total value goes over 21 and therefore, an automatic
            loss
          </dd>
          <dt>Hit:</dt>
          <dd>receive an additional card</dd>
          <dt>Stay/Stand:</dt>
          <dd>taking no more cards </dd>
          <dt>Push:</dt>
          <dd>having the same value as the dealer, which results in neither a win nor a loss</dd>
          <dt>*Draw:</dt>
          <dd>this has two meanings in Blackjack. Draw can either refer to "drawing a card/taking a hit" or a
            "draw/tie/push"</dd>
